Hack is a infrared based game, where players uses advanced gameplay to win. 
Rather than just having a player concept, many types and active objects will be added:

* healer player
* DPS player
* Support player
* Respawn point
* ... and more 

The code base targets high quality level and must keep a very high test coverage.
To ensure great behavior of hardware, testing automated scenario will be possible.
